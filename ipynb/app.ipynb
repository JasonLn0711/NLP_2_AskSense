    "💯 **Yes — having a bigger `faq_corpus` will almost always make your semantic search engine better** (as long as it’s clean and relevant). Let’s break it down clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why Bigger Is Better (Usually)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. **More Coverage = Better Matches**\n",
    "With more FAQs or documents, the system is more likely to contain:\n",
    "- Close paraphrases\n",
    "- Related intents\n",
    "- Answers that match different user phrasing\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "> User query: *\"How do I cancel my subscription?\"*  \n",
    "If your corpus only has:\n",
    "- *\"How do I reset my password?\"* → ❌ poor match  \n",
    "But if you add:\n",
    "- *\"How do I stop being billed?\"*  \n",
    "- *\"Can I cancel my monthly plan?\"*  \n",
    "✅ Now the search engine returns useful results!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 2. **Better Generalization**\n",
    "With more samples, especially diverse phrasing:\n",
    "- The embeddings capture more **semantic variance**\n",
    "- Cosine similarity has **more candidates** to differentiate\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 3. **Improved User Experience**\n",
    "- Users don’t need to phrase things *perfectly*\n",
    "- The system feels smarter, more human-like\n",
    "- Example: Like Google search or chatbot response matching\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔎 But… Bigger Isn’t Always Better IF:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ 1. You Have **Duplicate or Noisy Data**\n",
    "- Repetitive or vague entries confuse similarity scores\n",
    "- Tip: Deduplicate your corpus and remove overly generic lines like `\"contact us\"` or `\"more info\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ 2. It’s **Too Domain-Diverse**\n",
    "If your FAQ file mixes banking, health care, and e-commerce questions together — similarity results may become messy unless you add **category filters** or **clustering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧰 Best Practices for Bigger Corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Use **clear, question-like sentences**\n",
    "- ✅ Remove duplicates or low-content lines\n",
    "- ✅ Group by topic (e.g., payment, account, delivery)\n",
    "- ✅ Consider precomputing embeddings if size > 10k\n",
    "- ✅ Save your `.pt` or `.npy` vectors for faster startup\n",
